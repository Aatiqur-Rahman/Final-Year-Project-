PROJECT GOAL: Our first goal is to provide data confidentiality. To achieve this goal we use a cryptographic algorithm (RSA) that encrypts data into human unreadable form. If any hacker or intruder got the data,  they got the data in an indecent form.  
Another barrier is the transmission medium. Here we use image steganography. An image consists of pixels.  Most traditional image steganography uses the LSB algorithm which modified three colors (red, green, blue) of a pixel. The real image is distorted which will increase the suspicion of the picture is being modified. So, any attacker can easily guess which image contains any secret message. To overcome the problem, we use 1 color ( green or blue ) according to the red of the image to insert 1 bit of data.Now the distortion rate decreased by approximately 25% and being less detectable by statistical analysis. 

RSA : RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. An equivalent system was developed secretly in 1973 at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) (the British signals intelligence agency) by the English mathematician Clifford Cocks. That system was declassified in 1997.[2]

In a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private). An RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are kept secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decoded by someone who knows the prime numbers.
